#Build Instructions#

##Build Environment##

The software was developed in Eclipse, and this is what has been used to produce a runnable jar file for use in the application.
To create this jar, import the project into Eclipse. Ensure all source files, images and external libraries are on the build path
for the project. Then right click the top level folder, and select `Create runnable jar`. Name this `MIDIBlocks.jar`. 

##Producing the Executable##

Launch4j has been used to convert the .jar to a .exe. Launch4j can be installed as per instructions on their website, 
<http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/>. Then run Launch4j and import the configuration `launch4jconf.xml` as included in the
repository. Select `build wrapper` and this will produce a .exe file, `MIDIBlocks.exe`.

##Creating the installer##

NSIS is used to create an installer for the software. NSIS can be installed via <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page>. 
After installing NSIS, simply right click the `midiblocks_setup.nsi` file and select `Compile NSIS script`. This will then
produce an installation file in the same folder. 

##Firmware Build Instructions##

The code can simply be imported as a project into Atmel Studio, then compiled. There are no special requirements.
